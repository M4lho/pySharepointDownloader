# pySharepointDownloader

A script that utilizes rclone to download sharepoint links you received.

Ever got a sharepoint folder link that has hundered of files that each is 1GB each, and the zip download button is useless? This script is for you

Requirement:

1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I think 3.8 and later should be OK, but I use 3.11 when developing this script)

2. [rclone](https://rclone.org/) (Must be available at PATH, or on Windows put it in pySharepointDownloader folder) (This program is awesome)

---

Usage:

1. Use textfile editor to edit config.py

2. If you are Windows user, click "run.bat"

3. If you are Linux user, use run.sh (Might work for other Unix file systems but I didn't test)
