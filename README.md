# pySharepointDownloader

A script that utilizes rclone to download sharepoint links you received.

Ever got a sharepoint folder link that has hundered of files that each is 1GB each, and the zip download button is useless? This script is for you

Requirement:

1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I think 3.8 and later should be OK, but I use 3.11 when developing this script)

2. [rclone](https://rclone.org/) (Must be available at PATH, or on Windows put it in pySharepointDownloader folder) (This program is awesome)

---

Usage:

1. [Download](https://github.com/axzxc1236/pySharepointDownloader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract pySharepointDownloader

2. Use textfile editor (Notepad) to edit config.py

3. If you are Windows user, click "run.bat"

4. If you are Linux user, use run.sh (Might work for other Unix file systems but I didn't test)
